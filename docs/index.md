## What is Sphinx Simplified?

Sphinx Simplified is an **opinionated**, **easy-to-understand**, **descriptive** guide to using Sphinx to document your Projects. It is authored in such a way that is quite *unlike* the official Sphinx Documentation. You won't find a list of every single way to set up your Project, or every single configuration option. Instead, you'll find some nice recommended practices.

I wrote this guide because when I was using Sphinx for the first time, I found it's Documentation a bit too complicated. It just kinda felt like a collection of Sphinx stuff, and was not exactly very beginner friendly. You kind of had to figure things out yourself. I don't want people to go through the same struggle as me, so I wrote this guide, in hopes that other people may see it, and it will be useful.
